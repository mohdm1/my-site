<h2> For my capstone class I built a drone with the purpose of collecting and disseminating information for humanitarian efforts such as wildfire firefighting and search and rescue. In other words it could take pictures and push them via the onboard wifi. I had a lot of fun putting it together and then flying it. </h2>
